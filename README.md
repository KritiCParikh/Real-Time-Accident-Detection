## Project Evolution

### Initial Project

The initial phase of the project laid the groundwork for real-time monitoring of vehicle data. The primary focus was on collecting and processing vehicle data streams to detect potential accidents. While the alert mechanism was basic, it provided a crucial first step in identifying critical conditions in real-time.

### Advanced Project

Building on the initial work, the advanced phase introduced several significant enhancements:
- **Improved Data Processing**: Optimized algorithms to handle real-time data streams more accurately, enhancing accident detection capabilities.
- **Real-Time Alerts Integration**: Leveraged services like **Twilio** to send real-time alerts via SMS, email, or phone calls when an accident is detected, greatly improving the system's responsiveness.
- **Enhanced Alert Mechanism**: Refined the alerting mechanism to ensure immediate communication of critical situations to relevant stakeholders.
